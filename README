Introduction
============
This is a collection of snippets for YASnippet for use with writing a
JavaScript file using the dojo framework.

Installation
============
I use Steve Yegge's excellent js2-mode so I defined a derived mode named
dojo-js-modeby adding this to my .emacs

      (define-derived-mode dojo-js-mode js2-mode "dojo")

I then created a the 'js2-mode' directory in my snippets directory and then
created the subdirectory 'dojo-js-mode' in that directory.  All of these
snippets are placed in the 'dojo-js-mode' directory.

Using The Snippets
==================
When I fire up a JavaScript file that will contain dojo, I immediately run
'M-x dojo-js-mode'.  Then all of these snippets are available.

I tried to keep the first two letters for each major function you might use a
lot in dojo.  Thus, 'dc' becomes 'dojo.connect', 'dr' becomes 'dojo.require'.
